Run make to compile the source
./blackjack to run the program

Some Info- 
I didn't know how to play Blackjack, so first step was to actually learn the 
game! Sorry for the long delay, been extremely tied up with coursework. 

Irrespective of the results could you do a code review ? 
I have not gone through a formal code review ever before so it would be 
insightful to get some general comments. 

Thanks
